            <p>Along the scenic South Fork of the Snake River, the 1-mile Cress Creek Nature Trail interprets life in the area as it is now and as it was long ago. The trail climbs through sagebrush-grass communities, over juniper-covered slopes, and along a lush perennial creek. When skies are clear, prepare for an expansive view of the Snake River, volcanoes and surrounding farmland.</p>
            <p>The nature trail is self-guided, with interpretive signs along the way. And across the street from Cress Creek Nature Trail there is a trail around the Snake River where you can fish with a license</p>

            <p>Some friends and I rented sandboards, hammocks and sleeping bags from the ORC and spent a night on the dunes. We hiked out until we found some trees, sandboarded for a while, then built a fire and made hot cider. With wind chill, that night got below 0 degrees, so Iâ€™m glad I brought an extra blanket! The sunrise was spectacular, and as my first time on dunes, the whole experience felt magical. I would go back in an instant!</p> 
            <p>Altogether, I spent ~30$, including the pizza I bought us.</p>
