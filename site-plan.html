      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The website is focused on serving students in and around BYU-Idaho and tourists traveling to West Yellowstone. Its primary goal is to help these individuals discover various activities in the area, offering alternatives to heavily congested tourist destinations. While many students and locals are familiar with popular spots like Fact Cats, Walmart, and Broulim's in Rexburg, they often miss out on the pleasures hidden in small businesses. This site aims to promote these hidden gems in the area, whether it's the outdoor paintball arena, numerous thrift stores, or local restaurants overshadowed by big corporate names.
